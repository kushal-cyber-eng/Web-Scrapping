# Web-Scrapping
Suppose you want some information from interent about any topic related to your project work. The information you want is huge in a size. In that case, copy and paste doesn't work. So, we use a concept or technique called Web Scrapping it mean collected a large amount of data directly from website. Most of this data is unstructured data in an HTML format which further converted into strucutured in a database (csv file format) data through data mining technique so that it can be used in various applications. 
Two parts are required in Web Scrapping, nameli the crawler and the scraper. The crawler is an artificial intelligence algorithm that suffer all over the browses following the links acroos the internet. The scrapper is a specific tool created to extract data from the website.

- Step 1: Making an HTTP request to a server
- Step 2: Extracting and parsing (or breaking down) the websiteâ€™s code
- Step 3: Saving the relevant data locally or in database
